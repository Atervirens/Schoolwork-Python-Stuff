# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems
+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting.

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 
this is an area for code or examples etc

Counting uses natural number
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

+ integer numbers
+ rational numbers
+ irrational numbers
+ real numbers
+ ordinal numbers

### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ base 10
+ base 16
+ conversion between denary, binary and hex

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ bit and bytes
+ units of kilo, kilbi, mega, mebi, giga, gebi, tera, tebi

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

+ The rightmost value represents whether or not the number is negative. 0 = Positive, 1 = Negative
+ Unsigned binary: 100010 (34)
+ Binary arithemtics is comparable to decimal, with the fact that only 2 different values exist kept in mind.
+ Unsigned arithmetics: 100010+011001=111011
+ Signed Arithemetics:
+ Signed binary in 2's compliment: 11011110 (-34)
+ Fixed point fractional numbers: 1110.0010 (14.125 in 8bit)

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
#### ASCII and Unicode
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
