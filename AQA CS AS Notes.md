# AQA CS AS Notes

## 3.5 Fundamentals of data representation

### 3.5.1 Number systems
+ natural numbers

**definition**: those are numbers used for counting.

**examples**: 0,1,2,3,4
``` 
this is an area for code or examples etc

Counting uses natural number
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

+ Integer numbers: Whole numbers (e.g. 1, 7, 145)
+ Rational numbers: Numbers that can be expressed as fractions (e.g. 0.5, 0.4, 0.125, 3.6, 1.333333...)
+ Irrational numbers: Can't be expressed in fractions (e.g. π, √2, √8)
+ Real numbers: Numbers that are rational, irrational or natural. Numbers that aren't imaginary in other words.
+ Ordinal numbers: Numbers used to indicate the position of a value in a sequence. (e.g. 1st, 3rd, 7th, 32nd)

### 3.5.2 Number bases
+ Base 2: those are binary numbers. example: 1010<sub>2</sub>. See [this site](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-5.html) for more infomation
+ Base 10
+ Base 16
+ Conversion between denary, binary and hex

### 3.5.3 Units of information
+ Bit and bytes
+ Units of kilo, kilbi, mega, mebi, giga, gebi, tera, tebi

### 3.5.4 Binary number system

+ The rightmost value represents whether or not the number is negative. 0 = Positive, 1 = Negative
+ Unsigned binary: 100010 (34)
+ Binary arithemtics is comparable to decimal, with the fact that only 2 different values exist kept in mind.
+ Unsigned arithmetics: 100010+011001=111011
+ Signed arithemetics: (to be understood)
+ Signed binary in 2's compliment: 11011110 (-34)
+ Fixed point fractional numbers: 1110.0010 (14.125 in 8bit)

### 3.5.5 Information encoding system

#### Character form of a decimal digit
+ Basically, in ASCII and Unicode, numbers are coded as characters by default. As result, without the proper programming, 5+34=534.
#### ASCII
+ Stands for American Standard Code of Information Interchange.
+ Originally used 7 bits, but updated to use 8 bits in 1980.
+ Values were assigned to both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as non-printing control characters and more.
+ Only worked for Latin languages.
+ Decimal numbers was not represented by their equivalent in binary. (e.g. 0110100 will print '4', but has an actual decimal value of 52.)
+ Unicode is the current encoding standard for giving every relevant character a binary value.
+ Comes in 8, 16 and 32 bit forms.
+ Created to allow
#### Error checking and correction

### 3.5.6 Representing images, sound and other data

#### Bit patterns, images,  sound  and other  data
#### Analogue and digital
#### Analogue and digital conversion
#### Bitmapped graphics
#### Digital representation of sound
#### Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
#### Data compression
#### Encryption
